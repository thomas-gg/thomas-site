                                            As a software engineer intern for the Cloud Productivity and Engineering team I developed a Jira plugin for an internal dashboard working closely with another intern and software team. I created functionality for template variables in the dashboard's
                                            editor which uses <b>JQL</b> (Jira Query Language) for the custom plugin sourced with the <b>Grafana UI library</b>, <b>React</b>, <b>TypeScript</b> and a <b>Go</b>                                            backend. The plugin enables users to create Jira queries and filter the results to store into a variable used in future queries.

                                            At Teradata I was a web intern on the Teradata Cloud UI team. I worked primarily in <b>Angular</b> using the Teradata Covalent UI platform to provide data visualizations and learned about web services for communication
                                            to complex systems. I also automated testing of the UI with <b>Cypress</b> by mocking end-to-end user interaction and stubbing network calls to test within the project pipeline.

                                            I was a tutor for <b>Introductory Data Structures</b> for two quarters and an <b>Advanced Data Structures</b> tutor for one! <br /> <br /> My responsibilities as a tutor were to grade homework, tests, and projects
                                            as well as hold tutor and lab hours. Our assignments were challenging for many students and helping them learn the best ways for them to solve issues has helped me to be a better problem solver. Helping students
                                            learn has been very rewarding and I enjoy being able to see my impact on other students and their growth.

                                            As a SPIS mentor, I worked with four incoming freshmen at my college doing <b>Python programming</b> projects and assignments. I advised their adjustment to college life by engaging in conversations about scheduling,
                                            dorm life, club activities, etc. I held office hours online where students joined or submitted questions and had one-on-one guidance with me. As a mentor, I worked with an ECE professor to <b>prepare labs, facilitate lectures, and grade homework assignments
                                            and projects</b>. <br /> <br /> Our labs and lectures were designed to teach python fundamentals as well as applications of Python, such as <b>pygame</b>. Each week I provided feedback on labs and data structures
                                            homework assignments for each mentee. As I mentored I saw the mentees grow in their confidence and knowledge and it was fulfilling to see what they do by themselves and what they ask me when it was beyond the
                                            predetermined labs.

                                        <p>This project is a continuation and rewrite of an older application.<br /> <br /> I joined the team in Fall quarter because I genuinely wanted to help create an impactful project. However, many of the members had
                                            decided to leave in Fall which meant I quickly assumed a leadership role and helped my team in any way I could. For example, the first task I worked on was fixing the Dockerfile so that the backend using it
                                            would be able to autoreload every save. I chose tasks similar to this as well as adding ocumentation to help less experienced programmers get started and be more inspired to continue working on the team. Reducing
                                            the complexity and scope for my teammates meant we were able to finish a great portion of the project and hopefully soon this project will be deployed :)<br /> <br />Being in a more leadership type of role also
                                            meant that I was able to get a full stack experience, strengthening my frontend knowledge as well as my API development knowledge. One of the coolest features I learned about was using server-side events (and
                                            the Event Source API) rather than sockets (or Socket.io). <br /> <br /> In terms of code, I mainly developed the backend on this project continuing the ongoing rewrite by writing validation for API routes, fixing
                                            tables to align with the frontend and writing new routes to create a system which allows users to send csv files containing all of their students (and enrolling them into our database)

                                        The Association for Computing Machinery is an organization on campus that is an inclusive member-first community for all who are interested in the field of computing. I was a member of the staff organization and then was a part of the founding team/division
                                        ACM Hack. ACM Hack teaches different courses throughout the year building upon guided projects with students during the school year. The <b>workshops</b> include topics such
                                        as <b>Python</b>, <b>Web Development</b>, and <b>JS</b>.

                                        <br /> <br /> In this position, I gave online workshops from all of the topics mentioned to other University students teaching web development.

                                            When I joined the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) I was not expecting very much as it was the first year the organization was at our school. However, it turned out to be an amazing community in which I wanted to be involved. So I joined the
                                            staff committee in the Fall which volunteers to help at events and workshops as well as promote the organization itself. <br /> <br /> Eventually I also was able to
                                            join and become a founding board member of the new sub-organization ACM Hack (school). This community hosts workshops in web development and I was working on creating some of those workshops. This community
                                            of students interested in technology has helped me grow my programming skills and has also turned out to be an amazing social experience. <br /> <br /> The ACM prides itself on its community and I appreciate
                                            that I can give back to the community of students through it. <br /> <br /> This organization is the best organization I have been in at UC San Diego and I grew exponentially because of this group. I never would
                                            have imagined holding workshops in front of so may people, but their inviting and supportive community made it possible. I was very nervous for my first workshop, but I only received positive advice (after honestly
                                            not doing the best I could have due to my nerves) and I was able to become a much better speaker for the following workshops.

                            My team of four developed a quiz webapp similar to Kahoot for the ACM at UCSD to use. I developed a MongoDB framework to hold quiz questions using references to reduce repetition and save space. I collaborated with a second back-end developer to use Socket.IO
                            to create game play. <br /><br /> From this project I learned more about API routes and solidified my knowledge in Express and MongoDB. <br /><br />

                        <p>
                            Starting in my senior year of high school I joined a team of three to develop a Virtual Tour of our high school campus. I architected the backend for the project to store/retrieve users and images from <b>MongoDB</b> using
                            <b>NodeJs</b>. I wrote the connection to the frontend with <b>JQuery and AJAX</b>. Users can click on doors to view pictures and videos uploaded by teachers who have an account related to their door. My team's computer science
                            teacher deployed the project to his server to show students during the quarantine.
