                        <p> I have been fortunate to work with amazing students at UC San Diego in clubs doing work that will benefit others as well as work with an industry team at Teradata! I strive to join meaningful teams that will have a positive impact.

                        <p> On top of being a CS tutor and in CS organizations I like to play guitar, have fun with friends, walk/hike, and I <i>love</i> cats!

                                            I was a tutor for CSE 12 (introductory data structures) for two quarters and now I am a CSE 100 tutor (advanced data structures)! <br /> <br /> Working as a tutor is impactful for me emotionally as well as for
                                            my learning. My responsibilities as a tutor are to grade homework, tests, and projects as well as hold tutor and lab hours. I tutor for two courses taught at the same time focused on data structures, object-oriented
                                            design, and software tools. <br /> <br /> Our assignments are challenging for many students and helping them learn the best ways for them to solve issues has helped me to be a better problem solver. Helping
                                            students learn has been very rewarding and I enjoy being able to see my impact on other students and their growth.

                                            At Teradata I was a web intern on the Teradata Cloud UI team. I worked primarily in Angular using the Teradata Covalent UI platform to provide data visualizations and learned about web services for communication to complex systems. I also automated testing
                                            of the UI with Cypress by mocking end-to-end user interaction and stubbing network calls to test within the project pipeline. I enjoyed web development in general as well as working with my team. <br
                                            /> <br /> By helping on this team I positively impacted many people while also learning a significant amount about web development.

                                            As a SPIS mentor, I worked with four incoming freshmen at my college doing Python programming projects and assignments. I advised their adjustment to college life by engaging in conversations about scheduling, dorm life, club activities, etc. I held office
                                            hours online where students joined or submitted questions and had one-on-one guidance with me. As a mentor, I worked with an ECE professor to prepare labs, facilitate lectures, and grade homework assignments
                                            and projects. <br /> <br /> Our labs and lectures were designed to teach python fundamentals as well as applications of Python, such as pygame. Each week I provided
                                            feedback on labs and data structures homework assignments for each mentee. As I mentored I saw the mentees grow in their confidence and knowledge and it was fulfilling to see what they do by themselves and what
                                            they ask me when it was beyond the predetermined labs.

                                        Triton Software Engineering (TSE) is a student organization on campus that provides pro-bono work for nonprofits within the San Diego community. In this organization, I have worked on the backend for an online cuisine ordering tool for the United Women
                                        of East Africa Support Team. This tool allows for San Diegans to enjoy East African cuisine while supporting a good cause! For this project specifically, I worked on implementing the backend by creating routes in
                                        Express to interact with Mongo databases so that UWEAST may have a menu with items, orders, and admin users. <br /> <br /> My second project with TSE is for Sakyadhita a San
                                        Diegan Buddhist organization, and my team has been able to start this project from scratch. To implement the backend for this project I learned Sequelize and MySQL. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have learned a significant
                                        amount from TSE and I am extremely happy with how our team has built our community and projects. <br /> <br />

                                        When I joined the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) I was not expecting very much as it was the first year the organization was at our school. However, it turned out to be an amazing community in which I wanted to be involved. So I joined the
                                        staff committee in the Fall which volunteers to help at events and workshops as well as promote the organization itself. <br /> <br /> Eventually I also was able to join and
                                        become a founding board member of the new sub-organization ACM Hack school. This committee hosts workshops in web development and I am working on creating some of those workshops. This community of students interested
                                        in technology has helped me grow my programming skills and has also turned out to be an amazing social experience. <br /> <br /> The ACM prides itself on its community and I appreciate that I can give back to the
                                        community of students through it.

                            My team of four developed a quiz webapp similar to Kahoot for the ACM at UCSD to use. I developed a MongoDB framework to hold quiz questions using references to reduce repetition and save space. I am collaborating with a second back-end developer to use
                            Socket.IO to create game play. From this project I have learned more about API routes and solidified my knowledge in Express and MongoDB.

                            Starting in my senior year of high school I helped to create a virtual web tour of the MVHS. Users can click on doors to view pictures and videos uploaded by teachers who have an account related to their door. The project utilizes NodeJs, JQuery, HTML,
                            CSS, MongoDB while also combining the Unity Game Engine Build for WebGl. My team's computer science teacher deployed the project to his server to show students during the quarantine and we are most likely giving the whole project
                            to our teacher so that he may influence the next generation of computer science students at MVHS to build onto it.
